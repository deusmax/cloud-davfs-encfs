  Encode your data with =EncFs= and upload it, encoded, to the cloud using =WebDAV=.

  The command cloud-davfs-encfs, encrypts your data using =Encfs=, setup a =WebDAV=
  connection with your cloude provider and upload the encrypted data. All your cloud
  data will be always encrypted. The un-encrypted files always stay on your local
  machine(s). Only you have the encfs password.

  By using an easy to remember unique identifier, multiple cloud instances and cloud
  providers can be used, independently. But the mechanics and operation remains the
  same. =Cloud-davfs-enfs= will create a new tree structure for each identifier.

  This is a bash script that wraps around to sync your files and data encoded to the
  cloud. It sets-up the =WebDAV= connection with your cloud provider and encrypts your
  data using =Encfs=.
